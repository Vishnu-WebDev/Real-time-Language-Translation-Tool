# Real Time Language Translation API Project

## Overview
This project is part of my internship at Code Clause where I explored and implemented a real-time language translation API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim was to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for language translation on the web.

## Features
- Real-time translation of text input into multiple languages.
- User-friendly interface with smooth transitions.
- Cross-browser compatibility ensured for a wider audience reach.
- Asynchronous requests handling for seamless translation without page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
To use the translation feature, simply enter your text in the input field and select the desired language from the dropdown menu. The translated text will appear instantly on the screen.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-translation-api.git`
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Launch the `index.html` file in your web browser.
